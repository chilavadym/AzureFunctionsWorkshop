# Real Time Flight Maps w/ Azure Functions, CosmosDB & SignalR

## What we will cover

In this workshop we will be building a (near) real-time flight tracker app that leverages several Azure technologies.

- We will be using Azure Maps to draw the map canvas in our web app.
- To get the flight information, we will create a timer triggered Azure Function to pull the latest flight data set from the OpenSkys public API. The flight data will then be persisted in a Cosmos Database.
- We will then create an Azure Function that listens to the Cosmos DB change feed and updates an Azure SignalR hub with all changes to the flight data. 
- Finally the web app will be configured with a SignalR client to handle the data changes in real-time.

## What you will need

- Microsoft Azure Account
- Visual Studio 2017
- Azure Function CLI Tools *(Will be downloaded automatically when debugging functions locally)*

## Azure Cosmos DB

[**Azure Cosmos DB from the docs**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction)

*Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, globally-distributed, horizontally scalable in storage and throughput, multi-model database service backed up by comprehensive SLAs. Azure Cosmos DB was built from the ground up with global distribution and horizontal scale at its core - it offers turn-key global distribution across any number of Azure regions by transparently scaling and replicating your data wherever your users are. You can elastically scale throughput and storage worldwide and pay only for the throughput and storage you need. Azure Cosmos DB guarantees single-digit millisecond latencies at the 99th percentile anywhere in the world, offers multiple well-defined consistency models to fine-tune for performance and guaranteed high availability with multi-homing capabilities - all backed by industry leading service level agreements (SLAs).*

*Azure Cosmos DB is truly schema-agnostic - it automatically indexes all the data without requiring you to deal with schema and index management. Azure Cosmos DB is multi-model - it natively supports document, key-value, graph and columnar data models. With Azure Cosmos DB, you can access your data using NoSQL APIs of your choice. Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, enterprise ready and trustworthy service. All your data is fully and transparently encrypted and secure by default. Azure Cosmos DB is ISO, FedRAMP, EU, HIPAA, and PCI compliant as well.*

# Creating the Web App

The web app we are going to build is a simple flight tracker app. 

## Create a new Map

1. Open up visual studio code and create a new project directory for this project.
2. In the new project folder create a subdirectory called `Web`
3. In the `Web` directory create a new file called `index.html` 
4. Copy the following boilerplate code and then we will fill rest.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
 <head>
     <title>Live Flight Data Map</title>
     <meta charset="utf-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

     <!-- Add references to the Azure Maps Map control JavaScript and CSS files. -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://atlas.microsoft.com/sdk/javascript/mapcontrol/2/atlas.min.css" type="text/css">
     <script src="https://atlas.microsoft.com/sdk/javascript/mapcontrol/2/atlas.min.js"></script>

     <!-- Add a reference to the Azure Maps Services Module JavaScript file. -->
     <script src="https://atlas.microsoft.com/sdk/javascript/mapcontrol/2/atlas-service.min.js"></script>

     <script>
     function GetMap(){
         //Add Map Control JavaScript code here.
     }
     </script>

     <style>
         html,
         body {
             width: 100%;
             height: 100%;
             padding: 0;
             margin: 0;
         }

         #myMap {
             width: 100%;
             height: 100%;
         }
     </style>
 </head>
 <body onload="GetMap()">
     <div id="myMap"></div>
 </body>
 </html>
```
5. Go ahead and grab the subscription key for your Azure Maps account that you created earlier.
6. Add the following javascript snippet to the `GetMap()` function and your subscription key to the placeholder.

```javascript
//Instantiate a map object
var map = new atlas.Map("myMap", {
    //Add your Azure Maps subscription key to the map SDK. Get an Azure Maps key at https://azure.com/maps
    authOptions: {
        authType: 'subscriptionKey',
        subscriptionKey: '<Your Azure Maps Key>'
    }
});
```

7. Save your changes and open your `index.html` file in a browser. You should now see a really basic map of the world.

![BM](Artifacts/BasicMap.png)

## Customize your map

To keep things simple and to ensure that this map of the world include New Zealand, we will scope the map to New Zealand specifically.
Add the following options/settings to the `GetMap()` function, just below the `authOptions` section. 
```javascript
style: "night",
center: [171.7799, -40.838875],
zoom: 6
```
Refresh the page in your browser and notice, the map is now zoomed in on New Zealand and we've made it dark! 
You might need to tweak the **center coordinates** and **zoom** settings to get a better fit for your screen size and if you are after different styles or other custom configurations, take a look at the **Map** component section of the docs.

- [Map Control Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/azure-maps-control/atlas.map?view=azure-iot-typescript-latest)

## Lets Add Some Planes!!

Sweet map... but you said there would be planes! Adding the planes to the map is going to require a couple of things so lets kick right into it.

First we need to query the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/) API to get the flight data. The OpenSky Network provide open air traffic data for research and non-commercial purposes. They do provide more comprehensive licensing models should you need it but for the purposes of this workshop we will use the public endpoint.

To simplify matters further and reduce the payload size, given we have scoped our map map to just New Zealand, the RESTful calls to the public API contain the boundary coordinates for New Zealand so that we only fetch flight data for flights on our map.

In your browser or your favorite http client tool run the following GET request to the OpenSky Network API and familiarize yourself with the response body. Notice the **longitude** and **latitude** query params, these are just a rough estimate. Feel free to tweak these or make up your own all together. If you do change the location, don't forget to update your maps **center coordinates** we set in the previous step otherwise you won't see any flights in your region later on.

- [Here are the docs describing the JSON payload](https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/rest.html#response)
- [GET Request](https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all?lamin=-50.00&lomin=160.00&lamax=-30.00&lomax=180.00) `https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all?lamin=-50.00&lomin=160.00&lamax=-30.00&lomax=180.00`
